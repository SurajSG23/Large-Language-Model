### What are LLMs?

* LLM = **Large Language Model**.
* They are AI models trained on huge amounts of text.
* Main job: **predict the next word** in a sentence.
* Because of this, they can **understand, generate, and reason with language**.

### How Large is an LLM?

* Size = number of **parameters** (like memory slots).
* Small models → millions of parameters.
* Big models → billions (even trillions) of parameters.
* Larger models usually = **smarter**, but need more power to train and run.

### General Purpose Models

* Trained on **all kinds of data** → not limited to one task.
* Can answer questions, write stories, summarize, code, translate, etc.
* Act as **foundation models** → can be adapted for special use.

### Pre-training and Fine-tuning

* **Pre-training:** Model learns from a **giant dataset** (general world knowledge).
* **Fine-tuning:** Model is given **extra training** on specific tasks (e.g., medical Q\&A, customer support).
* This combo makes LLMs both **broad** and **specialized**.
